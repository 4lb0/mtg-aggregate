# MTG Aggregate
An app to generate an average deck list from an archetype.

## What is this?

This is a way to generate an average deck list from an archetype by using the algorithm described by Frank Karsten in his article [A New Way to Determine an Aggregate Deck List](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/magic-math-a-new-way-to-determine-an-aggregate-deck-list-rg-dragons/).

## How to use

First go to a site like [MTG Goldfish](http://mtggoldfish.com/) to download all the decks you want to merge.

## FAQ

* Is Arena supported?

  Not yet. Right now you can upload the file to another site and then exported to Arena.

* Why the app is so ugly?

  I want to make a fast site and also I am not a designer.
